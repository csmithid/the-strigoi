<h1>Story</h1>
      <p>
        You were just beginning your adventure when you fell into a hole by a
        river.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine the sense of good fortune when you found the infamous McGuffin,
        right here on the floor, at the bottom of a waterlogged cavern!
      </p>
      <p>
        The fall left you with a battered body. At this point in your adventure,
        there's no way for you to fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        And unfortunately, it seems your discovery has attracted the attention
        of the cavern's locals...
      </p>
      <h1>Rules</h1>
      <p>
        Your wounds will bleed periodically, and you're out of healing supplies.
        Every time you ascend stairs, your bleeding will become more frequent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any blood that falls into water will be washed away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monsters can smell blood from any distance, and they'll go slurp up the
        nearest pool. If they see movement, however, they'll give chase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standing still makes you hard to see. Monsters will only attack you if
        they are right next to you while you're standing still. If you stand
        still in water, they can't see you at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you move further out through the cave, the space opens up. You'll
        also encounter larger pools of water.
      </p>
      <h1>Design Thinking</h1>
      <p>
        I am interested in roguelike games that are less resource management,
        and more positioning / tactics. Strigoi explores a game system in which
        the player's only tools are their movement, and their environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by moments in 3D stealth games where you must wait with bated
        breath as a search pursuer runs past you, I wanted to explore situations
        where stealth was an option, and 'not moving' was a tactical choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wanted to explore storytelling through player actions. You'll
        learn more about the monster by being close to it, more about your
        wounds by being wounded, and more about your history through
        advancement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game definitely needs more mechanics to be sucessful. It's more of a
        puzzle to be solved at the moment, and you're not necessarily given a
        solvable problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Included support for vi keys (my personal preference) as well as numpad
        and arrow buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Care was taken in symbol selection and color choice to accomodate those
        with visual limitations.
      </p>
      <h1>7DRL</h1>
      <p>
        The 7DRL challenge is a 15-year long annual game jam. The goal is to
        produce a finished traditional roguelike game in 7 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        7DRL Challenges are NOT about being a fast coder, but rather proving you
        can release a finished, playable roguelike to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        is no winner of the challenge, but rather all those who finish are
        honored for their work, the criterion is completeness.
      </p>
